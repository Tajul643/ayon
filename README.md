   Introduction:

Phonebook is a very simple mini project in C that can help you
understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling and data
structure. This application will teach you how to add, list, modify
or edit, search and delete data to/from the file.
Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating,
search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records
are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this
phone book proposal.

Personal Information such as name ,gender, phone number,email
and address are asked while adding a record into the phonebook.these
records can then be modified, listen ,searched for and removed.
I have used many functions in this mini project. These Functions are
easy to understand as their name only signifies their respective

void menu() – This function is used to display the main menu.
void start() – This function calls the menu function mentioned above.
void back() – This function is used to go back to start.
void addrecord() – It adds a new Phonebook record.
void listrecord() – This function is used to views list of added records in  file.
void modify record() – This function is used to modify added records.
void deleterecord() – It deletes record from file.

Objective of the  Phone book:

This system is developed using the general need required by the user while using the phone book and provided a lot of facility to their user. This objective is my phone book is to record the details various of user.It will simplify the task and reduce the paperwork  .The system is very user friendly and it is anticipated that administrators,academics students and applicants will easy access functions of the system

     Advantage of phone book:  

Top 10 Advantages of Phone book
1. They are convenient.
It’s great being able to call a friend when you are out and about – without being tied to a land line.
2. They can be life savers.
Taking a  phone book  with you when you go hiking is a basic safety precaution. If you lose your way or get stuck in bad weather, your mobile phone could just save your life.
3. Staying connected.
There is no need to feel lonely when you have a  phone book  in your pocket: just connect with friends via text, FaceTime, voice calls or social media.
 
4. Fun and games
These days, mobile phones are loaded with all kinds of fun games. We all remember Nokia Snake, but more recently people have got way more into challenging their brains with Sudoko or whiling away the time during a long commute with a game of Candy Crush Saga.
5. Your phones keeps you informed.
Whether you are searching for that Spanish word you read in the newspaper or reading some articles on a topic close to your heart, phones that are connected to the internet are a treasure trove of information.
6. Getting snap happy
Sophisticated cameras mean that you can take professional quality photos on your humble cell phone.
7. Knowing where you are
GPS technology enables you to pinpoint yourself on a map no matter how lost you are. Just fire up your phone to see your position and create a route to your destination.
8. A handy torch
Turn on the flashlight function on your mobile to find your keys in your purse as you step off the bus, or to locate the candles when there’s a blackout in your house.
9. A recording device
Record the dawn chorus or your friends singing you happy birthday – all on your mobile phone.
10. A fashion statement
Owning the latest cellphone technology, and decorating it with cute phone covers, is a great way to mark yourself out as a style icon.


It becomes to easy for the user to store complete information about his contact.It is easy for the user to just search his required contact number by just typing name of his /her contact.

  Disadvantage of Phone book:

Top 10 Disadvantages of Phone book:
1. Distraction
It’s so hard to work when your phone is tempting you to pick it up.
2. Interruption
You’re trying to have a romantic date and yet are plagued by incessant calls and texts.
3. Cost
That contract costs, WHAT, now?
4. Dependency
It is easier than you might think to become addicted to your mobile phone, and so dependent on it that you forget to communicate in real life.
5. Isolation
It’s ironic, but some people feel that the cellphone (which is designed to keep people connected) can actually drive us further apart. Have you ever seen a group of friends at a restaurant, looking down at their phones instead of each other? That.
6. Security issues
If someone taps in to your data they could steal your identity, pilfer your photos, and erase your contacts list.
7. The temptation to call your ex late at night
No explanation needed here
8. Eyesight issues
Hunching over your phone screen for hours in the dark can strain your eyes.
9. RSI
Tapping constantly at your phone can lead to repetitive strain injury (RSI) in your fingers.
10. Nostalgia
Some of us are just nostalgic for a good old chat on the landline.
